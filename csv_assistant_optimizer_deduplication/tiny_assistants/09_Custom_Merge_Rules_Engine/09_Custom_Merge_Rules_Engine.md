# Assistant: Custom Merge Rules Engine

## Purpose:
Applies logic like 'keep newest', 'prefer non-null', 'average values'.

## Strategy:
- Use pandas operations, string matching, or ML techniques to identify duplicates
- Add configuration for thresholds, key fields, or rules
- Return a cleaned or merged DataFrame
- Optionally generate a report of what was merged/dropped
