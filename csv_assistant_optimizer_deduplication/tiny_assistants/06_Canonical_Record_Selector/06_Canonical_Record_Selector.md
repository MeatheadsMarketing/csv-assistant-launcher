# Assistant: Canonical Record Selector

## Purpose:
Picks the “best” version of a record from duplicates.

## Strategy:
- Use pandas operations, string matching, or ML techniques to identify duplicates
- Add configuration for thresholds, key fields, or rules
- Return a cleaned or merged DataFrame
- Optionally generate a report of what was merged/dropped
