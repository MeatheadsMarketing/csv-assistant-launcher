# Assistant: Primary Key Detector

## Purpose:
Identifies candidate columns that can serve as primary keys.

## Strategy:
- Use pandas or custom logic to detect schema-level features
- Allow users to confirm/override detected schema in UI
- Output structured schema report or tagged DataFrame
- Useful as a precursor to validation and enrichment
